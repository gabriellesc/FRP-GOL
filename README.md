### A very simple FRP JS implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
- Built to demonstrate Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) in JavaScript for CSC302H1 (Winter 2018).
- Uses [Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) and React.js.
- Modeled after the Haskell FRP Game of Life from Tikhon Jelvi's talk, [A Sensible Intro to FRP](https://begriffs.com/posts/2016-07-27-tikhon-on-frp.html).
- Responds to regular ticks, cell clicks, and pausing/unpausing.
